model landing page for a commercial touring agency website 

This webpage was not designed by me

the designing copyright goes to Jonas Schmedtmann, Professional web designer.

I just tried to replicate it with some of my own styles with reference of his udemy course "Advanced CSS and Sass Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!"

It contains a lot of rarely used advanced css features  like check-box hack, css pop-up etc...

People think most of the features in this page cannot be implemented without js but thats not true.

This project just contains 5 lines of js for just one functionality.

refer the udemy course to master css...
